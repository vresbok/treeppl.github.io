# Using the Python and R Environments Tutorial

Currently, there are two interfaces to TreePPL, and R and a Python package. 

`treepplr` is an R package for using TreePPL available on [github](https://github.com/treeppl/treepplr). See the full package documentation [here](https://treeppl.org/treepplr/index.html).

`treeppl-python` is the Python interface to TreePPL, also available on [github](https://github.com/treeppl/treeppl-python).
